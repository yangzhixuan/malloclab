My CS:APP malloc lab implementation. 
It uses a best fit strategy for allocationg blocks. Segregated lists and red black tree (AA tree precisely) are implemented
for performance.

It works well for test data used by PKU (100 points) but not tested with the CMU data.

However, you *SHOULD NOT* read or copy this code before doing the malloc lab homework if you are also a student learning CS:APP.
